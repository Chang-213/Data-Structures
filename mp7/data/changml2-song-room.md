You enter the room. Through the speakers you can hear 22 by Taylor Swift playing. You can't focus with the song on, you're trying to decide if its better to try to turn the song off, or if you should just leave the room. Alternatively you could also reward yourself and just dance.

# changml2-song-off
You walk to the podium in the front of the room and turn the song off.

# changml2-song-yeet
You think to yourself that you're an engineering student, better leave this one to the pros. You run as fast as you can out the doors.

# changml2-song-dance
The room is empty and with nobody watching you decide to dance.
