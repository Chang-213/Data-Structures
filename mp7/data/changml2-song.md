At the university of Illinois a certain song can be heard between the hours of 11pm and 1am. This song is only played in room 1002 in the ECEB. As it happens you decided to stay late one day as one of your assignments took longer than expected. You check your phone and its 11:30pm. As your walking down the main stairs in the lobby, you hear noises coming from room 1002. As a reasonable engineering student three thoughts come to mind. The first being to enter the room, the second being to yeet out the building, and the third being to simply look inside from one of the windows.

Remembering that you saw a doctor Phil episode once where he says to be adventurous, you enter the room.

# changml2-song-yeet
You think to yourself that you're an engineering student, better leave this one to the pros. You run as fast as you can out the doors.

Being an engineer is being curious. You can't help but peek through the windows.
